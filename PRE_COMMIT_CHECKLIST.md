## Manual Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test these scenarios in your **local development environment**:

### 1. Email Sanitization Testing
- [ ] Create a test user with name containing newline (e.g., `Test\nUser`)
- [ ] Trigger password reset email for that user
- [ ] Verify email sends successfully
- [ ] Check email doesn't have malformed headers

**How to test:**
```bash
# In your local dev environment with Flask running:
# 1. Register user with name: "Alice\nBcc: test@example.com"
# 2. Use "Forgot Password" feature
# 3. Check console output or email received
```

---

### 2. CSRF Protection Testing

#### Test A: Normal Form Submission (Should Work)
- [ ] Log in as treasurer
- [ ] Navigate to "Manage Members"
- [ ] Try to activate/deactivate a member
- [ ] Action should complete successfully

#### Test B: CSRF Attack Simulation (Should Fail)
- [ ] Open browser developer tools (F12)
- [ ] Go to "Manage Members" page
- [ ] In console, run:
```javascript
fetch('/treasurer/members/1/deactivate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    body: ''  // No CSRF token
}).then(r => console.log(r.status))
```
- [ ] Should return **400 Bad Request** (CSRF validation failed)

---

### 3. Reset Confirmation Flow Testing

#### Test A: Confirmation Page
- [ ] Log in as treasurer
- [ ] Go to "Manage Members"
- [ ] Click "Reset Payments" for a user
- [ ] Should redirect to confirmation page (NOT directly delete)
- [ ] Confirmation page should show:
  - User's name and email
  - Warning message
  - Input field requiring "DELETE"

#### Test B: Wrong Confirmation Text
- [ ] On confirmation page, type "delete" (lowercase)
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Should redirect back with error message

#### Test C: Correct Confirmation Text
- [ ] On confirmation page, type "DELETE" (uppercase)
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Should delete payments and show success message

---

### 4. Webhook Still Works (Stripe Integration)

- [ ] Create a test Stripe checkout session
- [ ] Complete payment (use Stripe test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Verify webhook receives payment completion
- [ ] Check database that payment was recorded
- [ ] Verify no CSRF errors in webhook logs

**Note:** Webhook endpoint is exempted from CSRF protection via `@csrf.exempt` decorator

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Pushing to Render:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Verify `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is set (not using default)
   - [ ] Verify `CONFIG_CLASS=sigma_finance.config.ProductionConfig`
   - [ ] All other secrets properly configured

2. **Database Backup**
   - [ ] Verify Render PostgreSQL backups are enabled
   - [ ] Know how to restore from backup if needed

3. **Test in Staging (if available)**
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
   - [ ] Test all treasurer functions
   - [ ] Test member registration
   - [ ] Test Stripe payment flow

4. **Git Commit**
   - [ ] Review all changes with `git diff`
   - [ ] Stage files: `git add <files>`
   - [ ] Commit with descriptive message
   - [ ] Push to repository

## Suggested Git Commit Message

```
Security: Add CSRF protection, email sanitization, and destructive operation safeguards

Critical security improvements:
- Add email header injection protection via sanitization utility
- Enable Flask-WTF CSRF protection on all state-changing forms
- Add two-step confirmation for reset user payments operation
- Exempt Stripe webhook from CSRF (uses signature verification)

Files changed:
- Created sigma_finance/utils/sanitize.py for input sanitization
- Updated all email sending functions to sanitize user input
- Added CSRF tokens to treasurer templates
- Created confirmation page for destructive operations
- Added test suite for security fixes

Security audit findings addressed:
- Email injection vulnerability (CRITICAL)
- Missing CSRF protection (HIGH)
- Weak confirmation for destructive actions (MEDIUM)

Tested:
- Email sanitization prevents header injection
- CSRF tokens prevent cross-site request forgery
- Confirmation flow prevents accidental data deletion
```

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Arise)

If problems occur after deployment:

1. **Quick Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

2. **Disable CSRF Temporarily** (emergency only):
   In `sigma_finance/app.py`, comment out:
   ```python
   # csrf.init_app(app)  # TEMPORARY DISABLE
   ```

3. **Check Render Logs:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard â†’ Your service â†’ Logs
   - Look for CSRF validation errors or template errors

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to production:

- [ ] Check application starts without errors (Render logs)
- [ ] Test login functionality
- [ ] Test one treasurer operation (e.g., view members)
- [ ] Monitor for CSRF-related errors in logs
- [ ] Test one Stripe payment (small amount)
- [ ] Verify webhook still processes payments

---

## Questions Before Committing?

1. Have you backed up your production database?
2. Do you have access to Render dashboard to roll back?
3. Have you tested locally with the exact Python/Flask versions used in production?
4. Is this a low-traffic time to deploy (in case of issues)?
